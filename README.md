# Uninitialized State Variable in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: attempting to access a state variable before it's been initialized.  The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

In React Native, when a component renders, it might try to access state variables before the state has been fully set up, especially with asynchronous operations. This leads to undefined values, resulting in errors or unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution often involves using conditional rendering to prevent rendering until the state is ready, or utilizing the `useEffect` hook to manage asynchronous state updates and render the component only after the state is populated.
